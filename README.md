# mgrep

**mgrep** efficiently prints lines that match **billions of strings**.  

While Google can search billions of web pages for a keyword in a split second, **mgrep** is optimized for the reverse problem: searching billions of keywords against a short piece of text, also in a split second.  

Under the hood, it uses a [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) for command 'match', and [Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree) algorithms for command 'index' and 'extend'.  

Since 2009, **mgrep** has been powering the backend of the [Annotator at the National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator).  

If you run **mgrep** in daemon mode, check out the Java client: [mgrepclient-java](https://github.com/daimh/mgrepclient-java).
