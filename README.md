# mgrep

**mgrep** efficiently prints lines that match **billions of strings**.  

While Google can search billions of web pages for a keyword in a split second, **mgrep** is optimized for the opposite task: searching billions of keywords within a short piece of text in a split second.  

It has been used as the backend for the [Annotator at the National Center for Biomedical Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/annotator) since 2009.  

If you are running **mgrep** in daemon mode, check out the Java client here: [mgrepclient-java](https://github.com/daimh/mgrepclient-java).
